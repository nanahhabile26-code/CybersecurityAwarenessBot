# Cybersecurity Awareness Bot

## About the Project

The Cybersecurity Awareness Bot is a C# application designed to promote cybersecurity awareness by providing users with helpful information, tips, and guidance on staying safe online.

The project aims to educate users about common cybersecurity threats and encourage safe digital practices through an interactive chatbot interface.

## Features

- **Interactive Chatbot:** Allows users to interact with the bot through a graphical user interface.
- **Cybersecurity Tips:** Provides information about online safety and cybersecurity best practices.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Uses Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) to create an accessible desktop interface.
- **Input Handling:** Processes user input and responds to supported questions and keywords.
- **Audio Functionality:** Includes sound functionality for an enhanced user experience, where configured.
- **Modular Code Structure:** Separates interface, chatbot logic, and supporting functionality into different components.

## Technologies Used

- C#
- .NET
- Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
- XAML
- Visual Studio
- Git and GitHub

## Cybersecurity Topics

The chatbot can be developed to provide guidance on topics such as:

- Password security
- Phishing and suspicious links
- Online privacy
- Malware and viruses
- Safe browsing practices
- Protecting personal information

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have:

- Windows operating system
- Visual Studio with the .NET desktop development workload installed
- A compatible .NET SDK
- Git, if you want to clone the repository

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone YOUR_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL
   ```

2. Open the downloaded project folder.

3. Open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio, or open the project file (`.csproj`).

4. Restore any required NuGet packages.

5. Build the project by selecting **Build → Build Solution**.

6. Run the application using **F5** or **Start** in Visual Studio.

## Project Structure

The project may include the following components, depending on the current implementation:

- `MainWindow.xaml` — Defines the graphical user interface.
- `MainWindow.xaml.cs` — Handles interface events and user interactions.
- `ChatEngine.cs` — Contains the chatbot's response and processing logic.
- `BotResponses.cs` — Organises chatbot responses, if implemented separately.
- `SoundManager.cs` — Manages audio functionality, if included.
- `CybersecurityAwarenessBot.csproj` — Contains project configuration and dependencies.

## How to Use

1. Launch the Cybersecurity Awareness Bot application.
2. Enter a question or keyword related to cybersecurity.
3. Submit your input through the chat interface.
4. Read the chatbot's response and cybersecurity guidance.
5. Continue interacting with the bot to explore other supported topics.

## Learning Objectives

This project provides practical experience in:

- C# programming and object-oriented development
- Building desktop applications using WPF
- Handling user input and application events
- Separating user interface code from application logic
- Implementing basic chatbot functionality
- Using Git and GitHub for version control

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements include:

- Expanding the chatbot's knowledge base
- Adding more cybersecurity topics and examples
- Improving input validation and error handling
- Enhancing the graphical interface
- Adding additional accessibility features
- Implementing automated tests for chatbot responses
